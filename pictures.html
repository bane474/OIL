        <h3>The Forge</h3>

        <p> To start forging the knife, I had to create the forge itself. This forge is made out of firebrick and is coated on the inside with refractory cement. It was fired with a 500,00 BTU propane torch (Who doesn't love Amazon), which I also use to heat my blade.</p>

        <p>Above is a 3d model as well as an engineering drawing of the forge. I used OnShape to model the forge and for the physical bricks I used simply an angle grinder.</p>

        <p>For the Forge I made two types of front walls. I made one where I would be able to watch the material, if the temperature (color) needed to be very accurate. Then a solid front for when I just need the material to heat fast.</p>
